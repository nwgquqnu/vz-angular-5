# Demo Angular5 Shop application 

This application contains mocked list of Products which can be added to a cart and removed from it

Each item in the cart has a number input which allows user to change item quantity.

Notification area shows last performed event

When user clicks on Welcome text or Product text then text color is changed to lightsalmon

LocalStorage is used to store elements of the cart, so cart items are present on page reload 

 CartService uses ConfigOptionsService to determine key for the LocalStorage
